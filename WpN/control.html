When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
When I behold the violet past prime,
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; 
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
Then of thy beauty do I question make,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow;
  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

I've been waiting for a guide 
to come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel 
the pleasures of a normal man?
These sensations barely interest me 
for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, 
take the shock away
It's getting faster, moving faster now, 
it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the backstairs, 
it's a no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, 
getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, 
let it out somehow
What means to you, what means to me, 
and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, 
I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell, 
and who gives a damn right now
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, 
then you know
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling.

This is the room, the start of it all
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall
I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained
Where will it end? Where will it end? 
These are your friends from childhood, through youth
Who goaded you on, demanded your proof
Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin
Where will it end? Where will it end? 
This the car at the edge of the road
There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat
There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak
Where will it end? Where will it end? 
This is the room the start of it all
Through childhood, through youth
I remember it all
Oh, I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained
Where will it end?  Where will it end? 

Forced by the pressure
The territories marked
No longer the pleasure
Oh, I've since lost the heart
Corrupted from memory
No longer the power
It's creeping up slowly
That last fatal hour
Oh, I don't know what made me
What gave me the right
To mess with your values
And change wrong to right
Please keep your distance
The trail leads to here
There's blood on your fingers
Brought on by fear
I campaigned for nothing
I worked hard for this
I tried to get to you
You treat me like this
It's second nature
It's what we've been shown
We're living by your rules
That's all that we know
I tried to get to you.

Guess your dreams always end
They don't rise up just descend
But I don't care anymore
I've lost the will to want more
I'm not afraid not at all
I watch them all as they fall
But I remember when we were young
Those with habits of waste
Their sense of style and good taste
Of making sure you were right
Hey don't you know you were right?
I'm not afraid anymore
I keep my eyes on the door
But I remember
Tears of sadness for you
More upheaval for you
Reflects a moment in time
A special moment in time
Yeah, we are wasted our time
We didn't really have time
But we remember when we were young
And all of God's angels beware
And all you judges beware
Sons of chance, take good care
For all the people not there
I'm not afraid anymore 
Oh, I'm not afraid anymore

A change of speed, a change of style
A change of scene, with no regrets
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget
Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say
We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
" We'll give you everything and more,
the strain's too much, can take much more".
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore
It was me, waiting for me
Hoping for something more
Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else.

Confusion in her eyes that says it all
She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by
She's lost control
And she gave away the secrets of her past
And said I've lost control again
And of a voice that told her when and were to act
She said I've control again
And she turned around and took by the hand and said
I've lost control again
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said
I've control again
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd died
She said I've lost control again, she's lost control
Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case
And say she's lost control again
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
And said I've lost control again
But she expressed herself in many different ways
Until she lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
And laughed I've lost control again
She's lost control again, she's lost control

To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you
I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more
As the assassins al grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left
I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let them use you for their own ends
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.

I travelled far and wide through many different times
What did you see there?
I saw the saints with their toys
What did you see there?
I saw all knowledge destroyed 
I travelled far and wide to many different times
I travelled far and wide through prisons of the cross
What did you see there?
The power and glory of sin
What did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins
I travelled far and wide through many different times
I travelled far and wide and unknown martyrs died
What did you see there?
I saw the one sided trials
What did you see there?
I saw the tears as they cried
They had tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes.

I walked through the city limits
Someone talked me in to do it
Attracted by some force within it
Had to close my eyes to get close to it
Around a corner where a prophet lay
Saw the place where she'd a room to stay
A wire fence where the children played
Saw the bed where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I had no time to waste
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine
The cars screeched hear the sound on dust
Heard a noise just a car outside
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled in close by  the building's side
In a group all forgotten youth
Had to think, collect my senses now
Are turned on to a knife edged view
Find some places where my friends don't know
And I was looking for a friend of mine
And had no time to waste
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same
Getting darker now, faces look the same
And I walked round and round
No stomach, torn apart
Nail me to a train
Had to think again
Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!
Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out
Four, twelve windows, ten in a row
Behind a wall, well I looked down low
The lights shined like a neon show
Inserted deep felt a warmer glow
No place to stop, no place to go
No time to lose, had to keep on going
I guess they died some time ago
And I was looking for a friend of mine 
And I had no time to waste
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

We were strangers
We were strangers, for way to long, for way to long
We were strangers, for way to long
Violent, violent
We were strangers
Get weak all the time, may just past the time
Me in my own world, yeah you there beside
The gaps are enormous, we stare from each side
We were strangers for way too long
Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon
Me in my own world, the one that you knew
For way too long
We were strangers for way too long
We were strangers
We were strangers for way too long
For way too long.
